### DotaHub
I'm a fan of the video game [Dota 2](http://dota2.com). I'm also a hobby programmer and enjoy learning and exploring new things. ***DotaHub*** is my attempt at making a site that may have some benefit to the community and will be fun for me to write.

#### Features
At current ***DotaHub*** has the following features planned:
* Running list of major patches
* Information for every hero
* Information for every Dota 2 item
* A component to test builds calculating from purchases, ability selections, talent tree, etc.
* Everything available in a format convenient if you're on your phone or at your computer.

#### How was this made?
I'm using [VueJS](http://vuejs.org) and [Vuetify](http://Vuetifyjs.com). Both of which I like very much.
